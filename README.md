### Couple folders in this repository

- Prioritization phase1 WGS
- Prioritization phase2 GENO
- Comparison with WGS
- Genetic integrity

### Prioritization phase1 WGS


### Prioritization phase2 GENO


### Comparison with WGS


### Genetic integrity
Assessing the Genetic integrity of genotyping data based on B allele frequency and Log R ratio.
Prior to working here you need to have exported from genome-studio the CNV file more details are in Genetic_integrity_prep.sh

This script is using the R package: GWASdata 
Gogarten S (2019). GWASdata: Data used in the examples and vignettes of the GWASTools package. R package version 1.24.0.
Which uses GWASTools with reference Gogarten 2012: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23052040

There are 5 files in this folder:

Genetic_integrity_prep.sh => This is the script to prepare the data
Genetic_integrity_run_all.sh => This is the script to run all samples
plot_per_chip.R => This file is needed to run each sample
anno_file_neurochip.txt => This file is needed for the annotation of the NeuroChip content
scan_file.txt => This file is needed for the input of the plot_per_chip.R script
